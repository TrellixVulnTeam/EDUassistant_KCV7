# Short message from dev

***It is here!*** The test release of an app is done. After a lot of work, I hope you will find a bunch of bugs in it (**sarcastically said**). Now there are all of the initially planned features (MyTools, MyTasks, Staff). Nothing is done yet a lot of work is left especially for my design crew who are planning on **completely redesigning the app**. That means a lot of stuff for me also because you know how that goes usually. Also, there is a whole list of features I am planning to add in the future. For now, I‚Äôll take some rest and let them design what we need. Feel free to report any bugs if you see them or if you have an idea contact mail is somewhere above this message. See ya soon!! üòé
