# Alpha 0.3 log

It is morning I am tired and just realized that I commited files as "Aplha" instead of "Alpha" SMH. But for the update...

## Python

**Python** is here 
my favorite language and the one I am most skilled in. ***GIT Hub*** calculated a lot of python and other stuff for this project languages even though
that is *not the case*. A lot of it is because I added the *python folder* in the app with all the libraries because windows do not come with python
installed, so sorry for that I'll see what I can do... What I did with python is that I made a simple ***webscraping script*** that allows you to go to
Croatian national site where you can see your grades and other stuff (eDnevnik) and there it gathers professor and subjet names and writes
it to dictionary later converted to JSON you can see it [here](https://github.com/ivandoslic/EDUassistant/blob/main/staff/connect/get-professors.py).
I will try to add some new and fun stuff with python later, but for now this is the only use case.

## Desing

Team is already in the redesing process and it looks ***AMAZING***, in a couple of days with alpha 0.5 I hope to release the whole redesigned app.
I won't spoil anything for now.

## Website

Also the website update. We started working on the website on which you'll be able to download the app. I am working on making the .msi file for installing EDU Assistant as it is growing a lot. It acctualy almost doubled in size as od Python implementation so it takes a lot of time for older computers to extract everything from the .zip file.
